    """
    Finds all contours of the specified color range in the provided image.

    Args:
        color_image: The color image in which to find contours,
            with pixels represented in the bgr (blue-green-red) format.
        hsv_lower: The lower bound for the hue, saturation, and value of colors
            to contour.
        hsv_upper: The upper bound for the hue, saturation, and value of the colors
            to contour.

    Returns:
        A list of contours around the specified color ranges found in color_image.

    Note:
        Each channel in hsv_lower and hsv_upper ranges from 0 to 255.
